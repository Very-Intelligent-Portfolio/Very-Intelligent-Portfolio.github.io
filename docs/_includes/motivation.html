                <hr class="primary">
                <p>Retail investors, particularly those with concentrated stock positions from employer compensation, often face challenges in <strong><em>managing portfolio risk</em></strong> due to limited access to sophisticated investment tools and strategies. The disparity between professional and retail investors' resources creates an uneven playing field, potentially leading to suboptimal investment outcomes for individuals. This situation is further complicated by the constraints of stock vesting periods with even more concentrated risks from both <strong><em>restricted stock investments such as RSUs/PSUs</em></strong> and employment within the same company or industry.</p>
                <p>There is a pressing need for an <strong><em>accessible, open-source</em></strong> solution that can provide retail investors with <strong><em>portfolio diversification and risk management</em></strong> capabilities, enabling them to make more informed decisions in the complex landscape of US capital markets.</p>
