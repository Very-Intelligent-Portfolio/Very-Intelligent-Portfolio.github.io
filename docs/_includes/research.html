                <p>We designed our survey to gain comprehensive insights into individual investors' behaviors, preferences, and challenges in the U.S. stock market. We aimed to understand investors' experience levels, decision-making processes, and trading frequencies, as well as their asset allocation strategies and potential barriers to market participation.</p>
                <p>The survey also explored the use of online investment tools and sought feedback on desired improvements in these platforms. Additionally, we investigated the impact of employer-granted stock compensation (RSUs and PSUs) on investment decisions and portfolio management.</p>
                <p>We also utilized the survey as an opportunity to gauge interest in and concerns about ML-driven investment recommendation tools, particularly a free deep-learning based system. We assessed respondents' risk tolerance levels to provide context for their investment approaches and preferences. This multi-faceted survey allows us to paint a detailed picture of modern retail investors' needs, behaviors, and attitudes towards a tool like Very Intelligent Portfolio.</p>
                <p>We received ~80 responses during a survey period of 2 weeks from MIDS community and personal contacts.</p>

                <p>As our primary object at Very Intelligent Portfolio is to help retail customers reduce investment risks, so we surveyed respondents from three different risk tolerance preference groups and identified meaningful attributes from each risk tolerance preference group.</p>

                    <li>Almost 40% of the “Conservative” investors invest less than 1% of their personal assets with around 10% investing more than 40%, in-line with the conservative risk profile of avoid volatile investment instructions such as the stock market.

                <p>That was a lot of information and we hope you found it as interesting as we found it to be! We also surveyed investors on their interest in utilizing VIP to assist with their investmant planning and received overwhelmingly positive interest in VIP!</p>
                <p>Based on the survey results, we are confident that there is a market interest and more importantly, there is a market need for VIP. We created three risk profile options for investors to choose from so we can provide the most relevant recommendations base on investor preference.</p>
