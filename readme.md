# Capstone project in MIDS for summer 2024

Our goal is to develop the first open-source stock portfolio builder that optimizes asset allocation and hedges downside risk for retail investors, particularly those holding stock options during vesting periods.

Unlike existing solutions that rely on proprietary, statistics-based models and algorithms, we plan to leverage recent advancements in attention mechanisms and transformer architectures.

By making our product freely available to the general public, we aim to empower individual investors with a powerful, transparent tool to better manage their financial success.
